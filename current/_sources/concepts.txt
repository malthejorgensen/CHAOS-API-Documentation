CHAOS concepts
==============

Objects
-------
Each media reference in CHAOS is called an ``Object``. Objects have a number of
fields (also called properties). The two most important properties are :code:`Files` and
:code:`Metadatas`.

 *  :code:`Files` is a list of files (media URLs) associated with the object
 *  :code:`Metadatas` is a list of metadata (XML strings) associated with the object

An overview can be seen in the figure below.

          ``Object`` properties
---------------------------------------------------------
Property name    Description
===============  ========================================
GUID             Unique ID of the object (a GUID)
ObjectTypeID     The type of the object
Metadatas        A list of metadata objects (Metadata)
Files            A list of file objects (FileInfo)
ObjectRelations  A list of objects related to this object

Files
-----
A file consists of a filename, a URL and some type specifications. The URL can
be used as-is, meaning that you don't have to concatenate the URL and the
filename.

A file has several different format specifiers. In order of most general to most
specific they are: 


1. **FormatType** is the type of the media: an image, a video, sound etc.
2. **FormatCategory** specifies in what context the media should be used. For
   example it could specify ``Image Thumbnail`` or ``Image Original`` so that a page
   showing many images should use the thumbnail (``Image Thumbnail``) whereas a page
   dedicated to that specific image should use the original (``Image Original``).
3. **Format** and **FormatID** are very specific: for example ``Image JPEG 200x200``.

.. note::

   This hierarchy is still under discussion and is subject to change. Furthermore
   no current CHAOS database lives up to this standard and thus you should ask or
   check your data to find how these format specifications have been used in your
   particular database.

          ``File`` properties
---------------------------------------------------------
Property name    Description
===============  ========================================
URL              Location of the file
Filename         The filename of the particular file
FormatType       Image, Video, Sound, Document
FormatCategory   Image Thumbnail, Image Original, Movie Clip, Movie Original etc.
Format           Image JPEG 320x480, Movie AVI 378x210 etc.
===============  ========================================

Metadata
--------
Every metadata XML-document has a related metadata schema. Things such the
title and description of the object is typically stored in the metadata. This
means that you can expect to find elements in the XML that contain the name of
object, a description and so on. 

==================  =====================================
          ``Metadata`` properties
---------------------------------------------------------
Property name       Description
==================  =====================================
GUID                GUID of the Metadata
MetadataSchemaGUID  The GUID of the XML schema describing
                    the MetadataXML XML document.
MetadataXML         The metadata as an XML document
==================  =====================================

Related objects
---------------
An object can have relations to other objects. These related objects can be
found in the ``ObjectRelations`` property of the ``Object``.  The related
objects are regular ``Object``\s and should be treated as such, although you
probably want to display them differently to the user (in comparison to the
primary object).

Object retrieval and search
---------------------------
The CHAOS database is indexed in a Apache Solr index, and searching but also
retrieving objects in general is done through this index.

To search the index you specify some query string and send it to CHAOS which
sends it on to Solr. The Solr query syntax is based on the `Lucene query syntax`_.
It is in general not necessarry to know the query syntax â€“ there are built-in
utility functions in the Portal.Client libraries and in CHAOS to handle most
common use cases.

Retrieving a single object can be done by "searching" on the GUID field:
GUID:object_guid and multiple objects can be retrieved by combining guid
searches: GUID:object1_guid OR GUID:object2_guid.


Here we search for

.. code-block:: none

   GUID:00000000-0000-0000-0000-00004e040016

which becomes

.. code-block:: none

   GUID%3A00000000-0000-0000-0000-00004e040016

inside the URL.

So the full CHAOS request URL becomes: (*note that you can't copy this directly
into the address bar as it contains linebreaks, here's a* link__ *though*)
